So you built this amazing ship, but it requires so much crew that it is costing
you more money than you can make. After spending all that time parking it
abandoned in the middle of nowhere, or destroying it completely, is such a waste
and if it served you well IT DESERVES BETTER THAN THAT.

With this mod you can mothball ships in your home sector, allowing you to remove
as much of the crew as you need. Normally, if you have less than 100% of the
mechanics a ship needs, it will slowly loose health until it dies. With this mod
you can pull all your crew except say, 25% of your mechanics, and your ship will
never fall below 25% health.

# Install

This mod only really needs to be on the server, but I highly suggest you install
it client side too.

Copy the data directory to your game or use the patches.
